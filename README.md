# PRODIGY_CYBER_TASK_01
A simple Python project implementing the Caesar Cipher algorithm with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. This tool allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by applying a shift value, making it a beginner-friendly introduction to cryptography and GUI development in Python.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features:

Encrypt and decrypt any message with a Caesar Cipher shift value.

Simple and clean user interface built with Tkinter.

Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Includes input validation and error handling via message boxes.

Beginner-friendly cryptography project with a real-time interface.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Project:

This project serves as a basic introduction to classical cryptography techniques while also integrating GUI development for a more interactive experience. It helps bridge the gap between theoretical encryption algorithms and practical cybersecurity applications.

Tech Stack:

Language: Python 3

Libraries: Tkinter (built-in)

Platform: Windows (runs on any OS with Python installed)
